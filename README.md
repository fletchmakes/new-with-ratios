# New With Ratios
![hero image](./assets/hero.png)

An Aseprite extension to create a new file that has ratio presets to make file creation easier.

## How to Use New With Ratios

1. Download this extension by visiting the releases page! (Double click the extension once downloaded to install)
2. In Aseprite, select `File > New With Ratio...`
3. The dialog will allow you to first specify your pixel art dimensions constrained to a ratio before moving onto the standard file creation flow!

Currently, the ratios supported are:

* 1:1
* 4:3
* 4:7
* 7:8
* 16:9
* Custom (define your own ratio!)

I'm open to adding more ratios to the script, so please let me know if you'd like to see another ratio in this dialog as well! It's minimal effort to add new ones, so don't be shy!
